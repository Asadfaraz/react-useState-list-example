# List Operations Example in React

## Details

In this example we can add a static data from using useState Hook. I
am using useState because I will remove items from this list and also
clear the whole list.

### First Commit

Reading data of objects in an Array called data and displaying
to the main screen using useState Hook.

Also Added some CSS for little bit styling.

### Second Commit

Added a button for removing all the items from the list. Meaning
making the list of data Empty so nothing will display on the
screen. Using the onClick function on this button I remove all the
elements from the data.

Also Added some CSS for little bit styling.
